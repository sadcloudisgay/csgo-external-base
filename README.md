# Up-to-Date CS:GO external cheat base for learning

I noticed there weren't any updated bases for CS:GO, as CS:GO is the most documented game for cheat development, ever.

## Features

1. Aimbot
2. Smoothing
3. Triggerbot
4. Glow (no flicker)

## I've multi-threaded everything, multi-threading is an important part of cheat development, so it's good practice and a good habit to have.

# The latest Hazedumper offsets for CS:GO are included as "csgo:offsets.hpp", as the official Hazedumper github repository is outdated.
